# House-Prediction
House prediction code typically refers to a machine learning model that estimates house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and other factors. 
1. Data Collection
The dataset is collected from sources like Kaggle, Zillow, or real estate databases.

Common features include:

Location (latitude, longitude, city)

Size (square feet, lot size)

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Year built

Nearby amenities (schools, hospitals)

2. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values (filling or removing)

Encoding categorical variables (like city names)

Normalizing or standardizing numerical data

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

3. Feature Engineering
Creating new features from existing data (e.g., price per square foot)

Selecting the most important features using correlation analysis or feature importance

4. Model Selection
Regression-based models like:

Linear Regression (for simple relationships)

Decision Trees (for rule-based predictions)

Random Forest (for better accuracy)

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) (for high performance)

Neural Networks (if deep learning is needed)

5. Model Training
Fitting the model to the training dataset

Adjusting hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search

6. Model Evaluation
Measuring performance using metrics like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RÂ² Score

7. Deployment (Optional)
Saving the trained model using Pickle or Joblib

Deploying as a web app using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit
